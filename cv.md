Cat Years
15 cat years for first year

+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that

```
const humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = humanYears => [
    humanYears,
    ( humanYears - 1 ? 16 : 11 ) + 4 * humanYears,
